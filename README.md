# Autism Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for autism diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The model leverages data from the `mail_test.csv` dataset, which contains various features relevant to autism assessment.

## Dataset

The dataset `mail_test.csv` includes the following columns:

- **Feature1**: [Description of the feature]
- **Feature2**: [Description of the feature]
- **FeatureN**: [Description of the feature]
- **Target**: Autism diagnosis (1 for diagnosed, 0 for not diagnosed)

### Example Data

| Feature1 | Feature2 | ... | Target |
|----------|----------|-----|--------|
| Value1   | Value2   | ... | 1      |
| Value1   | Value2   | ... | 0      |

## Objectives

- Preprocess the data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance.
- Train various machine learning models to predict autism diagnosis.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tusharkrishna27/Autism-Prediction.git
